# TODO

- [ ] HrAdminContentHeader height should be 32px not 33.5px
- [Â ] The tabs navigation should be 50px not 51px
- [ ] Clicking on "reclutamiento" should NOT close the panel

# MENTION IN README

- [ ] I added the token to the .env.local file assuming it's not used in production, it's generated by the backend after the login.
- [ ] The router is redirecting to the home view with the vacancy id, I did this because I imagine that the vacancy id will be in another part of the application.
- [ ] The time ago component is using the `useTimeAgo` hook from `@vueuse/core` instead of `useDateFormat`. Based on the figma design that is displaying "Hoy" I think that it's better to use `useTimeAgo`
- [ ] Use the `onClickOutside` from `@vueuse/core` to close the dropdown menu when clicking outside of it.
